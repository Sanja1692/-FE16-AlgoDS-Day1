array of number = {1, 3, 5, 4, 5, 9, 6, 1, 2, 6, 5, 4, 4, 9, 7 }


loop:

do until all numbers are read or max-number is found

read array
read 1st number.
is 1st number the max of numbers of the array THEN stop and write number is the max-number

else

go to the next number
is 2nd number the max of numbers of the array THEN stop and write number is the max-number




or



do until all numbers are read
count anzahl of numbers
i= 1
Is i = count +1 ? >>> then end!

read 1st number array(i)
compage with the 2nd number -
is array (i) > array (i+1)
(is the 1st number is higher than the second)
     then array (1) -> max_number
     then 1st number ist max-number

     else 
     i=i+1
     read array (i)



     read next number 
compare with max-number
is the next number higher than max-number 
    then next number is max-number, 
    max_number = array (i)
    else
        i = i+1
        read next number array (i)


is next number higher than max-number,
        then next-number is max-number
        else
            read next number
